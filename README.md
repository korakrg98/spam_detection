Focusing on email/SMS spam classification, this study explores diverse vectorization techniques and
ensemble models. Transforming textual data into vectors via Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec methods,
TF-IDF emerges as the most effective. Evaluation of Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and ExtraTrees
reveals their top performance. Employing Voting and Stacking ensembles enhances accuracy, with the Voting
Classifier achieving 98% accuracy and 100% precision in identifying spam. Deployment via Streamlit enables
cloud accessibility, showcasing the importance of comparative analysis. This work optimizes vectorization and
ensemble methods, culminating in a highly accurate spam classification system.
